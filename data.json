The thing is, Werner isn’t the hero or even the villain–he’s a background character likely to die during a climactic siege! Werner seeks out and befriends the hero, but he doesn’t have powerful enough skills to be a hero himself. Unwilling to die as a later plot point, Werner uses his knowledge of the game and his power as a noble to aid the hero and defend against evil attacks. That’s when he realizes that when he does so, he saves other people who were doomed as he was, which changes the “plot” he thought was inevitable. As the hero’s close comrade who can see the future, perhaps Werner will be a savior to this place, after all!",

Or will he be forced to relive three years of solitude as the most hated guy in school? He’ll need all the help he can get in order to succeed, from a workout regimen to online how-to guides, a childhood friend, and plenty of sheer willpower.
